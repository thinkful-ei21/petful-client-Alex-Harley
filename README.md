# Welcome to the Petful webapp!

## This app allows users to adopt animals that have been placed in a Queue data structure. 
## This way the first animal that is brought in will be the first to get adopted.

### This app is very easy to use.
### The main dashboard has two columns, one for the current cat up for adoption and one for the current dog up for adoption.

### Each column displays the animal's name, photo, and details.

### To adopt an animal just click the "Adopt" button below the animal you want.

### After a cat or dog is adopted the next cat or dog in the queue will be displayed.
![newCat](./pics/newCat.png?raw=true "New Pet")
### When all cats or all dogs have been adopted a "Reset" button will appear for that column which will reset the queue back to its original list.
